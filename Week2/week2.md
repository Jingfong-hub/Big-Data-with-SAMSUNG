# Cloud Computing
## The Evolution of Cloud Computing

The phrase “Cloud Computing” was first introduced in the 1950s to describe internet-related services, and it evolved from distributed computing to the modern technology known as cloud computing. Cloud services include those provided by Amazon, Google, and Microsoft. Cloud computing allows users to access a wide range of services stored in the cloud or on the Internet. Cloud computing services include computer resources, data storage, apps, servers, development tools, and networking protocols. Cloud computing is a cost-effective way for businesses to access a wide range of services without the need to invest in expensive hardware or software.

## Characteristics of Cloud Computing

Cloud computing has five essential characteristics: on-demand service, broad network access, resource pooling, rapid elasticity, and measured service. On-demand service provides users with the ability to access services as needed. Broad network access allows users to access the services from any device with an internet connection. Resource pooling allows multiple users to share resources in a multi-tenant model. Rapid elasticity enables users to access additional resources as needed. Measured service allows users to pay for services on a pay-as-you-go basis.

## Cloud Computing Models

There are three main cloud computing models: Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS). IaaS provides users with virtualized computing resources over the internet. PaaS provides users with a platform to develop, run, and manage applications. SaaS provides users with software applications over the internet. These models allow businesses to access a wide range of services without the need to invest in expensive hardware or software.

## Cloud Computing Deployment Models    

There are four main cloud computing deployment models: public cloud, private cloud, community cloud, and hybrid cloud. Public cloud services are available to the general public and are owned and operated
